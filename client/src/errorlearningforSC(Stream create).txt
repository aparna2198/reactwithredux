code 1:
    <form>
            <Field name="Title" />
            <Field name="description"/>
      </form>
error:Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined

learning: field itself has  no idea how to render some type of input element on screen 
so field doesnt know how to show a text input 
it doesnt know how to show a checkbox/dropped down or anything 
 It is just a component that is going to be a part of the system 
 thats going to automatically handle  all of the forms
 put together but it individually is not responsible for actually getting anything 

BASICALLY TOGETHER WE WIN  KINDA SITUATION 

solution: in order to show text input on screen we have  to assig a prop ot it called component
component could be 1) react component 2) fucntion for the field to call 
fucn needs to return some element that is going to be shown on the screen
